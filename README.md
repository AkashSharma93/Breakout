This is a simple implementation of the game Breakout. It uses the Slick game development library along with the LWJGL. You'll need those two and the native binaries LWJGL offers for your platform to run the game.
I haven't included the images for the buttons in the main menu here. You might want to make a directory and add whatever button images you like before playing the game.
